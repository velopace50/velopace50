Glad to see you here!
Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a senior Blockchain and Full-Stack developer who likes to work with Blockchain(Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Rust, Solidity, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155), JavaScript/Typescript (React, Angular, Vue.js, TensorFlow.js, Node, Nest,Express), Python among others.

Building state-of-the-art, easy-to-use, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine and I am confident I would be an excellent addition to your organization. In addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. This has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional work to all of my employers, including those I've worked for on a project basis.
